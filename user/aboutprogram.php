                    <p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme seeks to protect Indonesians against COVID-19, as well as to protect businesses and jobs through the progressive re-opening of Indonesia. Vaccination is free to all Indonesians people.<br><br> 

                        There is a risk of serious, life-threatening disease and death from COVID-19 infection, especially in the elderly and other vulnerable groups (e.g. persons with comorbidities). Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is one way to prevent the disease, minimise the risk of transmission, and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.<br><br> 
                        
                        It is important for us to achieve as high a level of population coverage as possible, to provide protection for the majority of our population. A population with high vaccination coverage against COVID-19 will indirectly protect those who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccination (e.g. severely immunocompromised individuals, subgroups such as children where safety data is not available), as the risk of transmission of the disease will be greatly reduced.<br><br>
